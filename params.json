{"name":"NewOpenBible Project","tagline":"CC-by-SA licensed modern translation of the Bible, in your own language","body":" the NewOpenBible\r\n==================\r\n\r\nour aim is to empower the people of the World to create a modern translation of the Bible that everyone can use in their own language, free from all copyright encumbrances, and as faithful to the original languages of the text as modern scholarship can enable us\r\n\r\nto help us in this endeavor, we are re-using existing texts in the public domain as our starting point and build upon these with modern emendation guided by state-of-the-art advancement in Bible scholarship\r\n\r\nwe also want to make inline references to Strong's concordance possible for advanced readers, which will also serve us with internal consistency and self-verifiability of the translated texts with their corresponding original languages\r\n\r\ntechnical notes\r\n---------------\r\nour efforts are inspired specifically by the hard work, scholarship and eloquence of previous translations:\r\n* New Revised Standard Version of 1989 (especially *the Common Bible* edition for all Christians);\r\n* New American Standard Bible of 1995; and\r\n* New English Translation of 2005\r\n\r\nour guiding original text references are:\r\n* Westminster [Codex Leningradensis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Codex)\r\n* [Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/), the [Leon Levy](http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/?locale=en_US) online archives\r\n* Novum Testamentum Graece, [Nestle-Aland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novum_Testamentum_Graece) 28th edition\r\n\r\nthe NewOpenBible will draw upon available texts in the public domain from two independent traditions:\r\n 1. the **[American Standard Version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Standard_Version)** (**ASV**) released 1901, former copyright has now expired so it is in the public domain and free to be published without payment of royalty---\r\n   * a free updated revision is the [World English Bible](http://WorldEnglishBible.org) (**WEB**), one of the two most popular public domain, modern-English translations of the entire Bible and freely distributed to the public using electronic formats, a Hebrew Names Version is also available as the World Messianic Bible or World English Bible, Messianic Edition (**WEB:ME**)\r\n 2. the Open English Bible (**OEB**) derived from the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament (TCNT) based on \"The New Testament in the Original Greek\" by [Westcott and Hort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westcott-Hort) in 1881, and public domain translations of the Hebrew Bible done by John E McFadyen and Charles F Kent based on the Westminster online digital copy of the [Codex Leningradensis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Codex) maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research at the Westminster Theological Seminary\r\n\r\nwe will avoid unnecessary interpretation; ambiguous cultural or technical references in the original will be preserved for the readers consideration with appropriate notes\r\nmost of all, we shall not diminish the divine glory and supreme authority of God as witnessed by the original scriptures, and proclaim how God is fulfilling His promises in the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen English Bible\r\n==================\r\nThe [Open English Bible](http://OpenEnglishBible.org) is the anticipated end product of a project intended to create an English translation of the Bible that is:\r\n\r\n* under a licence enabling the maximum reuse, remixing and sharing without requiring the payment of royalties or the obtaining of permission from copyright holders; and\r\n* a translation reflecting modern English usage and Biblical scholarship.\r\n\r\nThe New Testament of the OEB is being formed by editing the public domain Twentieth Century New Testament (TCNT), which was a new translation of the New Testament published in the early twentieth century, based on the Greek text of Westcott and Hort.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew Bible is being formed by editing a number of public domain translations done by John E McFadyen and Charles F Kent.\r\n\r\nAs such, the OEB as a translation does not stand within the Tyndale tradition but has a separate tradition in a similar manner to the NIV and New English Bible.\r\n\r\nIts website is at http://OpenEnglishBible.org\r\n\r\n\r\nThis site\r\n---------\r\nThis source tree contains:\r\n\r\nfinal-usfm/\r\nThe final generated usfm. This is probably what you want if you want to use the NewOpenBible usfm files.\r\n\r\nsource/\r\nThese are the OpenEnglishBible.org source files we are working from. They are USFM files with a layer of markup to handle variations.\r\n\r\nsrc-usfm/\r\nThese are the other source files we are working from (NOT from the OEB, but all in the public domain /CC0) originating from the ASV to modern emendations contributed by the WEB\r\n\r\nscratch/\r\nThese are various support documents such as books not yet fit for the development version.\r\n\r\nbuild.py\r\nThe python 2.x script which creates a set of USFM files from the usfm.db files\r\n\r\nbuild-standard.sh\r\nShell script which builds the two main sets of USFM files in final-usfm/us and final-usfm/cth\r\n\r\n\r\n## license / copyright status\r\n[![creative commons Attribution-ShareAlike License](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png \"creative commons Attribution-ShareAlike License\")](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\r\n\r\nall sources used are in the public domain in the original or are released here under the [creative commons 4.0 Attribution-ShareAlike License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), [3.5](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.5/), and [3.0 international](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and [PH-adapted local license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ph/) and all changes here are made available in (Attribution-ShareAlike License) the same free license for the sole purpose of availability and preserving freedom to use and share content, including transclusion in other relevant media under the same or any compatible license..\r\n\r\nthe Word of God spans millennia of Human History and we believe the message that frees all of us should be free from all arbitrary and artificial control in its translation and distribution as well\r\n\r\n## contributing\r\nchanges and improvements are more than welcome!

Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"UA-5372918-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
